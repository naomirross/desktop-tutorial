            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
            <uline>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</uline>
            <highlight>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</highlight>
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
            his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
            <redtext>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù </redtext>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile. 
            I said to myself, again: <redtext>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here,
            is his loyalty to a flower-the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lampp, even when he is asleep..."</redtext>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still.<uline>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</uline>
